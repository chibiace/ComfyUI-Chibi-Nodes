Standing
Sitting cross-legged
Arms outstretched to the sides
Leaning against a wall
Hands on hips
Kneeling with hands on the ground
One hand on chin in thought
Arms raised in victory
Reaching for the sky
Lying on your back with arms and legs extended
Sitting on a stool
Arms folded in front
One knee bent, resting on a rock
Hands clasped behind back
Hugging oneself
Posing in a yoga tree pose
Leaning forward with hands on knees
Lying on stomach with head propped on hand
Sitting with one leg tucked under
Crouching down
Hands in prayer position
Standing on one leg
Hands on a hip, one leg bent
Arms outstretched with palms up
One hand behind the head
Standing with one hand on the chin
Lying on the side with legs bent
Standing with one hand on a hip
Balancing on one foot
Arms stretched forward
Holding a bouquet of flowers
Kneeling with head resting on hands
Stretching arms behind
Sitting on a chair with one leg crossed over the other
Sitting on a step with legs extended
Lying on side with legs extended
One hand pointing forward
Standing with arms at sides
Leaning back with arms out
Sitting on the ground with legs wide apart
Posing as if dancing
Hands in a praying position
Sitting with legs crossed at ankles
One hand resting on a table
Holding a book
Sitting with one leg tucked under
Standing with arms crossed over chest
Arms extended to the side
Hands on hips, one leg bent
Lying on stomach with hands under chin
